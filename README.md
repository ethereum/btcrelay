# [BTC Relay](http://btcrelay.org)

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/ethereum/btcrelay](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/ethereum/btcrelay)

[BTC Relay](http://btcrelay.org) is an Ethereum contract for Bitcoin SPV.  The main functionality it provides are:

1. verification of a Bitcoin transaction
1. optionally relay the Bitcoin transaction to any Ethereum contract
1. storage of Bitcoin block headers
1. inspection of the latest Bitcoin block header that is stored

BTC Relay is [live](http://rawgit.com/ethereum/btcrelay/master/examples/relayContractStatus.html) on the testnet.


## API


##### verifyTx(transactionHash, transactionIndex, merkleSibling, blockHash)

Verifies the presence of a transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, primarily that the transaction is on Bitcoin's main chain and has at least 6 confirmations.

* `transactionHash` - hash of the transaction, as `uint256`
* `transactionIndex` - transaction's index within the block, as `int256`
* `merkleSibling` - array of the hashes of sibling transactions comprising the Merkle proof, as `int256[]`
* `blockHash` - hash of the block that contains the transaction, as `int256`

Returns `int256`
* `1` if transaction is verified to be on the Bitcoin blockchain
* or an error code, see [constants.se](constants.se)

*Note:* See [examples/sampleCall.html](examples/sampleCall.html) including use of [bitcoin-proof](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitcoin-proof) for constructing `merkleSibling`.

---

##### relayTx(rawTransaction, transactionHash, transactionIndex, merkleSibling, blockHash, contractAddress)

Verifies a Bitcoin transaction per `verifyTx()` and relays the verified transaction to the specified Ethereum contract.

* `rawTransaction` - hex string of the raw transaction, as `bytes`
* `transactionHash` - hash of the transaction, as `uint256`
* `transactionIndex` - transaction's index within the block, as `int256`
* `merkleSibling` - array of the hashes of sibling transactions comprising the Merkle proof, as `int256[]`
* `blockHash` - hash of the block that contains the transaction, as `int256`
* `contractAddress` - address of the Ethereum contract that will receive the verified Bitcoin transaction, as `int256`

The Ethereum contract should have a function of signature `processTransaction(rawTransaction, transactionHash)` and is what will be invoked by `relayTx` if the transaction passes verification.  For an example, see [example-btc-eth](example-btc-eth)

Returns `int256`
* value returned by the Ethereum contract's `processTransaction` function
* or an error code, see [constants.se](constants.se)

----

##### storeBlockHeader(blockHeader)

Store a single block header if it is valid, such as a valid Proof-of-Work and the previous block it reference exists.

* `blockHeader` - raw `bytes` of the block header (not the hex string, but the actual bytes).

Returns `int256`
* block height of the header if it was successfully stored
* `0` otherwise

----

##### bulkStoreHeader(bytesOfHeaders, numberOfHeaders)

Store multiple block headers if they are valid.

* `bytesOfHeaders` - raw `bytes` of the block headers (not the hex string, but the actual bytes), with one following immediately the other.
* `numberOfHeaders` - `int256` count of the number of headers being stored.

Returns `int256`
* block height of the last header if all block headers were successfully stored
* `0` if any of the block headers were not successfully stored

*Note:* See [deploy/relayTest/testBulkDeploy.yaml](deploy/relayTest/testBulkDeploy.yaml) for an example of the data for storing multiple headers.  Also, to avoid exceeding Ethereum's block gas limit, a guideline is to store only 5 headers at time.

----

##### getBlockHeader(blockHash)

Get the 80 byte block header for a given `blockHash`.  A payment value of
`getFeeAmount(blockHash)` must be provided in the transaction.

* `blockHash` - hash of the block as `int256`

Returns `bytes`
* block header, always as 80 bytes (all zeros if header does not exist)
* or `0` (as a single byte) if insufficient payment is provided

----

##### getBlockHash(blockHeight)

Get the block hash for a given `blockHeight`.

* `blockHeight` - height of the block as `int256`.  Minimum value is `1`.

Returns `int256`
* block hash
* `0` if not found

----

##### getAverageBlockDifficulty()

Returns the difference between the cumulative difficulty of the latest block and the 10th block prior.

This is provided in case an Ethereum contract wants to use the Bitcoin network difficulty as a data feed for some purpose.

----

##### getBlockchainHead(), getLastBlockHeight(), others

`getBlockchainHead` - returns the hash of the latest block, as`int256`

`getLastBlockHeight` - returns the block height of the latest block, as `int256`

See [BitcoinRelayAbi.js](examples/BitcoinRelayABI.js) for other APIs and [relayContractStatus.html](examples/relayContractStatus.html) for an example of calling some of them.

----

##### Incentives

The following APIs are described in `Incentives for Relayers` below.

`storeBlockWithFee()`, `changeFeeRecipient()`, `getFeeRecipient()`, `getFeeAmount()`, `getChangeRecipientFee()`

----

## Examples

* [sampleCall.html](examples/sampleCall.html) for calling `verifyTx` including use of [bitcoin-proof](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitcoin-proof) for constructing `merkleSibling`.

* [example-btc-eth](example-btc-eth) for relaying a Bitcoin transaction to an Ethereum contract using `relayTx`.

* [relayContractStatus.html](examples/relayContractStatus.html) for calling other basic functions.

----

## Incentives for Relayers

Relayers are those who submit block headers to BTC Relay.  To incentivize the community
to be relayers, and thus allow BTC Relay to be autonomous and up-to-date with the
Bitcoin blockchain, Relayers can call `storeBlockWithFee`.  The Relayer will be the
`getFeeRecipient()` for the block they submit, and when any transactions are verified
in the block, or the header is retrieved via `getBlockHeader`, the Relayer will be
 rewarded with `getFeeAmount()`.

To avoid a relayer R1 from setting excessing fees, it is possible for a relayer R2
to `changeFeeRecipient()`.  R2 must specify a fee lower than what R1 specified, and
pay `getFeeAmount()` to R1, but now R2 will be the `getFeeRecipient()` for the block
and will earn all future `getFeeAmount()`.

With this background, here are API details for incentives.

##### storeBlockWithFee(blockHeader, fee)

Store a single block header (like `storeBlockHeader`) and
set a fee that will be charged for verifications that use `blockHeader`.

* `blockHeader` - raw `bytes` of the block header (not the hex string, but the actual bytes).
* `fee` - `int256` amount in wei.

Returns `int256`
* block height of the header if it was successfully stored
* `0` otherwise

----

##### changeFeeRecipient(blockHash, fee, recipient)

Set the `fee` and `recipient` for a given `blockHash`.  The caller must send
exactly `getChangeRecipientFee()` to BTC Relay, and must also specify a `fee` lower than
the current `getFeeAmount(blockHash)`.

* `blockHash` - hash of the block as `int256`.
* `fee` - `int256` amount in wei.
* `recipient` - `int256` address of the recipient of fees.

Returns `int256`
* `1` if the fee and recipient were successfully set
* `0` otherwise

----

##### getFeeRecipient(blockHash)

Get the address that receives the fees for a given `blockHash`.

* `blockHash` - hash of the block as `int256`.

Returns `int256`
* address of the recipient

----

##### getFeeAmount(blockHash)

Get the fee amount in wei for verifications using a given `blockHash`.

* `blockHash` - hash of the block as `int256`.

Returns `int256`
* amount of the fee in wei.

----

##### getChangeRecipientFee()

Get the amount of wei required that must be sent to BTC Relay when calling
`changeFeeRecipient`.

Returns `int256`
* amount of wei

----
